# What Happens When You Don't Consider The Consequences

I've been reading about Data Ethics from the book "Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & Pytorch" recently. The authors bring up a lot of problems that can happen when
people create technologies (in this case, especially AI) without thinking what effects their product or research will have on other people. Great harm has come to many innocent
lives because of a lamentable and sometimes culpable lack of forethought. Sometimes, the issue lies with the data being used to train models.
I believe that most people naturally understand many aspects of what is right and what is wrong and should realize that all machine learning practitioners have a responsibility to try to prevent bias and
illigitimate use of machine learning, as well as other technologies and processes that could harm others.
